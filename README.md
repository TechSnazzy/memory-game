## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Game Description
Welcome to my Matching Game. At the start of the game, there will be a game board with 16 hidden cards. The player will tap or click to flip a card over which will reveal a symbol. The player will then tap or click to flip another card over. If both cards match then the cards stay flipped over and the player can then try to match two more cards. The game is over when the player has successfully matched all the cards. At the end of the game, the game will show the player all the game stats including a star rating, time to complete the game and the amount of moves it took. Then the player can either play again, or not.

This game has been tested to work on Mac, iOS, Android and Windows. It is responsive and has been tested on an iPhone X, 8" iPad mini, a large 24" monitor and a 13" laptop screen.
